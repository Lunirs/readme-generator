## Description

As your project is going to be public on github, it is very important that you describe your project so users can understand what they are working with prior to running it themselves. In order to inform the user, a detailed readme file is often needed.

## Installation

This portion of your readme should specify what the user must do after they download the code inorder to run it themselves. For example, npm i can be used to install inquirer in our case.

## Usage

This portion of the readme would provide users a video guide or screenshot guide on how the application can be used.

## Contributing

If you would like other developers to contribute to your project, you can add guidelines for the other users to follow.

## Tests

Test driven development is quite useful. If you have the time, you can write tests to show what each part of the application should do and test to see if they work or not.
